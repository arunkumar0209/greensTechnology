Inheritance
Accessing one class property from another class.
Re-usability of code
Memory wastage is low
uses keyword 'extends'

Types of Inheritance
	Single (explained in program, class EmployeeDetails & CompanayDetails)
	Multilevel (explained in program, class EmployeeDetails, CompanayDetails, & PersonalDetails)
	Multiple
	Hierarchical
	Hybrid


Multiple Inheritance

In java Multiple Inheritance is not supported due to compile time or syntax error.
JVM gets confused and goes to diamond or dead lock condition, since compiler does not know which method to compile when 2 methods in different class has same method name


Hierarchical Inheritance

class A (parent)
class B extends A (child1)
class C extends A (child2)
class D extends A (child3)

combination of one parent and more than one child.


Hybrid Inheritance

	class A (parent)
	class B (child1)
	class C (child2)
	class D (child3)
	class E (child4)
	

	single
		class A extends C
		
	Multilevel
		class B extends A
		class C extends B
	
	Hierarchical
		class B extends A
		class C extends A
		
		class D extends B
		class E extends B
		
	
combination of Single Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, and Hierarchical Inheritance is called as Hybrid Inheritance.
